A "simple-build-tool":http://code.google.com/p/simple-build-tool/ plugin/processor to create "IntelliJ IDEA":http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/free_java_ide.html project files for sbt project

h2. Requirements

- Sbt version 0.7.x (not compatible with 0.5.x series).
- IntelliJ Idea version 9.0.2 (not fully compatible with versions prior 9.0.2 because of a change in config xml format introduced in 9.0.2).

h2. Usage

Tool can be used either as SBT plugin or SBT processor (thanks to "teigen":http://github.com/teigen for the processor integration!). 

Usage as plugin requires modification of your project descriptor, whereas usage as processor is non-intrusive and requires only few commands on the sbt console. Instructions for both usage scenarios below.

h3. Usage as plugin

1. In your project/plugins/Plugins.scala:

<pre>
import sbt._
class Plugins(info: ProjectInfo) extends PluginDefinition(info) {
  val sbtIdeaRepo = "sbt-idea-repo" at "http://mpeltonen.github.com/maven/"
  val sbtIdea = "com.github.mpeltonen" % "sbt-idea-plugin" % "0.1-SNAPSHOT"
}
</pre>

2. In your project definition file:

<pre>
import sbt._
class MyProject(info: ProjectInfo) extends ParentProject(info) with IdeaProject {
  lazy val subProject = project("subproject", "subproject", new DefaultProject(_) with IdeaProject)              
   // ...
}
</pre>

i.e. plugin trait must be mixed into both parent project and subprojects if you have multimodule build.

3. Run

<pre>
 sbt update
 sbt idea
</pre>

4. Import created <project.name>.ipr file into Idea

Check out sbt's "plugin documentation":http://code.google.com/p/simple-build-tool/wiki/SbtPlugins for further details.

h3. Usage as processor

1. Start sbt console on the root of your project

2. Enter the following sbt console commands (* is part of sbt processor command syntax):

<pre>
 > *sbtIdeaRepo at http://mpeltonen.github.com/maven/
 > *idea is com.github.mpeltonen sbt-idea-processor 0.1-SNAPSHOT 
 ...
 > update
 ...
 > idea
 ...
</pre>

3. Import created <project.name>.ipr file into Idea

Check out sbt's "processor documentation":http://code.google.com/p/simple-build-tool/wiki/Processors for further details.

h2. Configuration

You can customize some attributes of generated Idea project descriptors in project/build.properties file. Currently supported properties are:

|_. Property |_. Description |_. Default value |
| idea.jdk.name | Name of the 'Project SDK' in Idea Module Settings | 1.6 |
| idea.include.sbt.project.definition.module | Generate Idea Module also for SBT project definition code | true |
